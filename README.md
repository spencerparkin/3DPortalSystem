# 3DPortalSystem

This is the restoration of a very old program I wrote in collage many, many years ago.  The name is misleading.  It is actually a 2D portal system, but it is all rendered in 3D.  At the time, I was a big fan of the show "who's line is it anyway?", and so you'll see the comics from that show featured in the game.  I don't recall what kind of feedback I got from the professor, but I think I passed the course.

This program certainly has its flaws, but it's fun for its historical and nostalgic perposes.  Looking at the old code, I can see that my style and skills have come a long way.  Sigh...  Those were simpler times.
